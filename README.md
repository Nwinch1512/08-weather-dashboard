## Description

This repo contains all files related to the week 8 weather dashboard project.

I was motivated to build the weather dashboard to further improve my skills in applying: JQuery, local storage and making third party API calls. The project also enabled me to further practise using moment JS and style the webpage in line with user requirements through using CSS and Bootstrap.

The weather dashboard enables users to enter a city name to search for weather conditions from today through to the next five days. Under the current and future forecasts, the dashboard presents the: city name, date, weather condition as an image, temperature measured in degrees celsius, wind speed measured in kilometres per hour, and humidity measured as a percentage. The weather forecast has been taken from the midday timepoint (halfway through the day) since free forecasts from OpenWeather were available in three hourly blocks but the user requirement was for just one forecast per day.

Users can search cities across the globe to access different forecasts and the dashboard stores previous search cities which users can click on to access weather information for different locations.

This project enabled me to consolidate and apply JavaScript, JQuery, Moment JS, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills in a single project.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The weather dashboard allows users to retrieve weather forecasts by city for today and the next five days. This would be useful for anyone that needed to compare current and future weather conditions by city name. In particular, this would be useful to anyone planning a trip over the next few days to inform them of destinations which had weather conditions most suited to their needs.

Please see below for a screenshot of the dashboard.
