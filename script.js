// Your Task
// Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

// Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. The link should take you to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API. You will need to register for an API key in order to use this API. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

// The base URL for your API calls should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

// Hint: Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you'll notice that you will need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name?

// You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys.

// User Story
// AS A traveler
// I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
// SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
// Acceptance Criteria
// Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
// When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
// When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
// The city name
// The date
// An icon representation of weather conditions
// The temperature
// The humidity
// The wind speed
// When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
// The date
// An icon representation of weather conditions
// The temperature
// The humidity
// When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
